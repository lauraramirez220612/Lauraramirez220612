### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Good Morning everybody! Let me introduce myself, my name is Laura Ramirez, I am from Peru and I lived 20 years in Spain, Now I live in Belgium. I studied Science of Communication and International Trade, I was always interested in Computer Science but I thougth it was so heavy to get on it. I started my journey with HackyourFuture Belgium to learn as much as possible with them and from my classmates and I felt happy to be there. As soon as I graduated as a Web DesignerðŸ’»(HTML, CSS, Javacript, SQL, VSC, MongoDB, UX, UI, Figma) I felt that my new challenge was learning Data Science. In my past jobs I had my first approaches to Data Base as using Access, Macros, Oracle, SAP, Cognos IBM. The last few years i've been learning PowerBI, Python, Tableau. As a millenial I am a firm believer that the new technologies help shape a better society with out forgetting the social relations and the critical thinking.
